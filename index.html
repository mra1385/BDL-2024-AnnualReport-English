The escalation of geopolitical tensions, such as shifting alliances and conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East, has increased the risks of disrupting trade, basic commodity markets, and reshaping investment flows, which has heightened uncertainty in trade policies and markets and harmed economic activity. Financial fragmentation is also deepening with the retreat of cross-border capital flows and increasing divergence in interest rates. Low-income countries are particularly vulnerable, facing difficulties in accessing financing and rising sovereign debt risks.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8161-ba0f-daf8872c8c41" class="">Indicators of stability began to emerge during most of 2024, following a long and difficult period of unprecedented shocks. Inflation rates have retreated from their highest levels in decades, showing a gradual decline despite some fluctuations, nearing central bank targets. Labor markets have also returned to their natural state, with unemployment and job vacancy rates returning to pre-pandemic levels. The growth rate reached about 3 percent in the last few years, and global output has approached its potential level. In this context, the global economy achieved a growth rate of 3.3 percent in 2024, compared to 3.2 percent in 2023. Global headline inflation also decreased during 2024, recording 5.8 percent, compared to 6.8 percent in 2023. This resilience in the global economy comes despite the wide divergence in cohesion across countries. While growth recorded a greater-than-expected slowdown in China, India, and the Euro area, in addition to a slight contraction in Japan, momentum in the United States remained strong, driven by consumption. As for emerging and developing economies, they have witnessed a slight decline in growth, affected by global uncertainty, trade tensions, and tightening financial conditions.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8132-a670-c8a2ba322c9e" class="">Global inflation remains on its downward path, despite signs of this decline slowing in some countries and its continued rise in a limited number of cases. Average headline inflation recorded 2.6% in advanced economies during 2024, while it reached 7.5% in emerging and developing economies. Global core inflation has stabilized at slightly over 2% during the last months of 2024. Indicators point to a slowdown in nominal wage growth, alongside signs of a gradual improvement in labor market conditions. Despite the decline of core inflation for goods to usual levels, services price inflation remains high compared to what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the United States and the Euro area. Some emerging markets also continue</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81ad-a9d9-e8c33f66a9a7" class="">2</p><hr id="245ca1c0-c75b-8197-a024-fc9f3bd68d47"/><h2 id="245ca1c0-c75b-81d6-bbb7-f7d0b5abed27" class="">Page 3</h2><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8169-83eb-f5e45dfd5e11" class="">[Image of the Cedar of Lebanon inside a frame]<br/>BANQUE DU LIBAN<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8161-b166-ecb418ad88e0" class="">Foreign Affairs Department<br/>***<br/>and economies, especially in Europe and Latin America, face high inflation rates, attributable to country-specific reasons in all cases.<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-810c-af70-e0d0a1e63340" class="">On the global monetary policy front, central banks continued to formulate their monetary policies during 2024 with a focus on domestic economic conditions and inflation, while taking into account counteracting external factors. In this context, central banks adopted a cautious monetary easing policy that in turn kept asset price volatility relatively low. The easing policy was reflected in the key interest rates of the Federal Reserve in the United States (4.6 points), the European Central Bank (3.15 points), and the Chinese Central Bank (1.5 points). It is noted that a few banks have started to raise interest rates. In this context, it was possible to contain the risks threatening financial stability in the short term. However, these easing financial conditions could facilitate the accumulation of vulnerabilities—such as overvaluation of assets, high levels of private and government debt, and the reliance of non-bank financial institutions on financial leverage—which will lead to increased economic uncertainty and uncertainty about future policies.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8144-a377-f57ab5788e06" class="">Global financial conditions are still characterized by a great deal of easing, despite the existence of divergences between different regions. Stock prices in advanced economies have risen, supported by expectations of more accommodative policies. In the United States, they recorded greater stimulus. In contrast, valuations in emerging and developing economies recorded lower levels. The tightening of monetary policy continued, and the US dollar continued to rise, driven by expectations of the imposition of new customs duties and rising interest rates.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8136-9f34-c9c827330b07" class="">The nominal value of total global debt rose during 2024 by about 7 trillion US dollars, to reach a new record level of 318 trillion US dollars by the end of the year. In parallel, the ratio of debt to global GDP rose to about 328 percent, the first increase in four years, with the slowdown in total GDP growth and the retreat of inflationary pressures. The debt of emerging markets reached a record 104 trillion US dollars at the end of 2024, with a ratio to GDP of 245 percent. Many emerging markets have witnessed a significant deterioration in their debt-bearing capacity in recent years, with the narrowing of the gap in growth rates between them and the advanced economies, and the continued rise in government interest expenses.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81e1-b367-da51294f3b26" class="">3</p><hr id="245ca1c0-c75b-81d9-90e5-d2e2d2dc6b12"/><h2 id="245ca1c0-c75b-819c-bcff-e83771b4832b" class="">Page 4</h2><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81b8-8824-c1b2b53e8f67" class="">[Image of the Cedar of Lebanon inside a frame]<br/>BANQUE DU LIBAN<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8114-b4af-e6798dc2acde" class="">Foreign Affairs Department<br/>***<br/>Regarding capital flows, emerging markets witnessed a notable increase in non-resident capital inflows, with net inflows into these markets exceeding 900 billion US dollars during 2024, an increase of about 32% compared to 2023. China captured a large share of this. These flows consist of portfolio investment flows worth 274 billion US dollars, and foreign direct investment flows estimated to rise to about 426 billion US dollars, driven by the recovery in major economies such as China, India, and Mexico, and other investment flows estimated at about 218 billion US dollars.<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8196-a1d9-da5fdc568aef" class="">Priorities in economic, financial, and monetary policymaking are focused on carefully calibrating short-term policies to ensure a soft economic landing. Many countries need to adjust their public finance policy approach to help put public debt on a sustainable path and build appropriate fiscal safety buffers, in line with each country’s circumstances. Restructuring is essential to improve medium-term growth prospects, along with the need to continue supporting the most vulnerable groups and strengthening social safety nets. The success of these reforms also requires strategies that enhance their social acceptance, as this is a fundamental condition for their effective implementation. However, the success of all these efforts requires broader international cooperation, aimed in particular at accelerating the transition to a green economy, supporting debt restructuring efforts, and mitigating the risks of geo-economic fragmentation. It is crucial to strengthen rule-based multilateral frameworks to ensure all economies benefit from future growth opportunities.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8155-8102-f9ee22af0317" class="">At the local level, as a result of a number of internal and external accumulations caused by regional turmoil since 2011 on the one hand, particularly related to the repercussions of the Syrian crisis, its risks, and the burdens of displacement it caused; the repercussions of the Corona crisis on the other hand; the difficulties facing public finances in terms of budget deficit and the exacerbation of public debt and its service on a third hand; the Russian-Ukrainian crisis on a fourth hand; and the state of instability that prevailed in the region following the Israeli war on Gaza and Lebanon on a fifth hand; the Lebanese economy has faced, for the fifth consecutive year, pressing conditions as a result of the multidimensional crisis it is going through. This renewed crisis is represented by the local inflationary financial-monetary factor, the imbalance in the balance of payments and the lack of liquidity, the factor related to the local energy crisis of fuel and electricity and its general economic effects, and the factor linked to global disruptions in supply chains and imbalances in energy and food markets.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8173-b485-c90f41c93498" class="">The recent Israeli war led to thousands of deaths and injuries, and the displacement of nearly 1.2 million people in Lebanon, which has had devastating effects on the lives of citizens and their social and economic conditions. The World Bank estimates the value of material damages at about 6.8 billion US dollars, and economic losses at about 7.2 billion US dollars, which exceeds half of Lebanon’s Gross Domestic Product. Lebanon continues to suffer from the burdens of the displacement crisis, as it is considered a center for the largest number of refugees/displaced persons per capita in the world.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81d0-a042-e13d9691209e" class="">4</p><hr id="245ca1c0-c75b-8117-a7cd-dac3ac425ac8"/><h2 id="245ca1c0-c75b-813c-b1fa-c1768e93a6ed" class="">Page 5</h2><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8138-8a81-c017486768eb" class="">[Image of the Cedar of Lebanon inside a frame]<br/>BANQUE DU LIBAN<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8145-8688-d86d53962057" class="">Foreign Affairs Department<br/>***<br/>This situation has put significant pressure on public services, infrastructure, the labor market, and the environment. The severity of the economic crisis was exacerbated by the Lebanese economy’s heavy reliance on imports, making it highly vulnerable to price shocks. The impact of this reality was reflected in a sharp decline in key economic indicators since late 2019, affecting the foreign trade, tourism, investment, consumption, and public spending sectors, coinciding with an unprecedented rise in prices. However, the last quarter of 2024 witnessed positive developments with the implementation of a ceasefire, political breakthroughs, and the emergence of signs of a return to the path of reform.<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81e4-b3b6-f2ebea04d24a" class="">The macroeconomy in Lebanon recorded a contraction of 6.4 percent during 2024, according to Banque du Liban estimates. The annual inflation rate reached 45.2 percent, compared to 221.3 percent for the year 2023. Additionally, the balance of payments (change in the net foreign assets of the financial sector)¹ recorded a surplus of 6.44 billion US dollars during 2024, compared to a surplus of 2.2 billion US dollars during 2023.² The trade balance deficit reached about 14.2 billion US dollars in 2024, which is 16 percent (ratio of exports to imports), compared to about 14.5 billion US dollars in 2023, recording a decrease of 2.3 percent compared to a decrease of 6.6 percent in the previous year. This development resulted from a decrease in imports by 3.6 percent and a decrease in exports by 9.6 percent during 2024, reaching about 16.9 billion US dollars and about 2.7 billion US dollars, respectively. As for remittances from expatriates to Lebanon, they recorded 6.8 billion US dollars during 2024, according to Banque du Liban estimates.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8112-b988-cb8e53e2dbe9" class="">On the monetary level, and as part of its efforts to unify the multiple exchange rates, Banque du Liban adopted a new official exchange rate of /89,500/ Lebanese pounds per US dollar starting from the first of January 2024. This new rate was applied to all banking transactions instead of the previously adopted rate of /1,500/ Lebanese pounds. The exchange rate of the Lebanese pound maintained its stability throughout the year, fluctuating slightly within the range of 89,600 – 89,700 Lebanese pounds per US dollar, even amid intensified pressures during the last quarter. This stability was achieved thanks to the implementation of strict traditional monetary policies by Banque du Liban, which included tight control over the money supply and a halt to government financing. Reserve assets in foreign currencies³ at Banque du Liban (excluding gold) increased by 8.7 percent from 9.3 billion US dollars at the end of December 2023, to 10.1</p><hr id="245ca1c0-c75b-8119-84bb-f4f9a565b1f6"/><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8189-9746-f6176e2802d6" class="">¹ Based on the recommendation of the International Monetary Fund, and according to the decision of the Central Council of Banque du Liban No. 23/37 dated 20/9/2023, and as of January 2024, the foreign assets of Banque du Liban include (1) Gold, (2) Non-resident foreign securities in the securities portfolio of Banque du Liban, (3) Foreign currencies and deposits with correspondent banks and international organizations, and (4) Bank loans in foreign currencies to local banks and financial institutions.<br/>² The balance of payments was calculated based on the new official exchange rate (89,500 Lebanese pounds per one US dollar).<br/>³ Based on the Central Council’s decision No. 13588 dated 25/10/2023 and based on the principle of commitment to best practices, international accounting standards, and prevailing norms, the item “Assets in Foreign Currencies” was reclassified to become “Reserve Assets in Foreign Currencies,” such that it only represents liquid and non-resident foreign assets.<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81a2-8691-f94114008452" class="">5</p><hr id="245ca1c0-c75b-811b-87d5-feb61b852601"/><h2 id="245ca1c0-c75b-81c7-9d68-c5e20f434e24" class="">Page 6</h2><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8105-8d89-f5a400205cdb" class="">[Image of the Cedar of Lebanon inside a frame]<br/>BANQUE DU LIBAN<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-8130-b1ec-f850e2303089" class="">Foreign Affairs Department<br/>***<br/>billion US dollars at the end of December 2024, compared to 38 billion US dollars before the outbreak of the crisis. As for the gold reserve, its value increased by 25.8 percent due to the rise in its international price, reaching about 24.1 billion US dollars at the end of 2024. Banks continued to impose strict restrictions on capital movement due to the lack of foreign currency reserves necessary to repay customer deposits. In this context, most commercial transactions are now conducted in cash instead of using checks, bank transfers, or credit cards, despite Banque du Liban taking steps aimed at curbing the expansion of the cash-based economy.<br/></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81e4-9e9c-c89263f6f847" class="">In light of the financial crisis, it became necessary to resort to partial dollarization of the economy as a means to ensure a minimum level of price stability. The private sector has come to rely widely on the dollar in its transactions, while the public sector continues to deal in the Lebanese pound, which has created a kind of balance between the two sides. This balance is evidenced by the stability of the currency, which does not require any direct financial intervention from Banque du Liban; on the contrary, the bank was able to strengthen its foreign currency reserves by about 800 million dollars.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81c9-b3d3-ea00ea77ef61" class="">As for public debt, the Ministry of Finance did not issue any official data for the year 2024.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81b6-a76a-d15124b94068" class="">Despite the economic and financial challenges, Banque du Liban has made efforts to support the resilience of the Lebanese economy. It has worked to achieve a delicate balance between maintaining the stability of the financial system by adopting a comprehensive macroprudential regulatory policy aimed at reducing systemic risks, and mitigating the effects of the crisis on production, currency stability, and prices through traditional and non-traditional monetary policy tools, especially by supporting the exchange rate in response to the government’s request.</p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81a2-95cb-ecef7759dcd2" class=""><strong>Section Two: The Executive Framework for Monetary Policy - Objectives, Tools, and Mechanisms</strong></p><p id="245ca1c0-c75b-81a8-9776-f86d6fa3ac48" class="">Within the executive framework for monetary policy, Banque du Liban has worked to achieve a set of basic objectives, the most prominent of which are: mitigating the impact of successive shocks on individuals and institutions by maintaining the exchange rate of the lira against the US dollar at stable levels, and ensuring the stability of the banking and financial sectors at this stage, which is characterized by stagnation and a high degree of uncertainty, pending the launch of the reform and restructuring phase.

These measures contribute to effective liquidity management, which in turn affects currency in circulation and monetary and financial stability. In this regard, Banque du Liban supervises the Real-Time Gross Settlement system (BDL-RTGS) and the retail payment system (BDL-CLEAR). It is also working on updating these systems according to the renewed global requirements of the SWIFT company by transitioning from the MTS SWIFT messaging payment system to a payment system that relies on SWIFT MX technology, in order to continue providing the best international standards adopted by all central banks in the world. In addition, Banque du Liban is coordinating with state administrations and keeping these administrations abreast of the most prominent developments in payment systems, especially with regard to managing the accounts of Banque du Liban’s customers, particularly public sector accounts, in line with Banque du Liban’s directions to develop and update the government payment system. Work has continued on launching this system to align with the requirements of public administrations and institutions, and it is expected to be launched during 2025, following a delay resulting from the Israeli war on Lebanon. This system will allow ministries, public administrations, and institutions in the Lebanese state to improve the efficiency of managing their open accounts at Banque du Liban directly, in real-time, electronically, and with the highest international standards and specifications related to security, transparency, and speed. This would positively affect their ability to manage their resources and view their revenues, payments, and balances in real-time and electronically. Work was also done on developing an advanced regulatory framework for electronic payments, especially electronic wallets, and work is underway to issue a new circular in the first quarter of 2025.
